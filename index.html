              WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for
              a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable
              target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust,
              enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
              Fast, safe, and portable semantics:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Fast: executes with near native code performance, taking
                  advantage of capabilities common to all contemporary hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Safe: code is validated and executes in a memory-safe,
                  sandboxed environment preventing data corruption or security
                  breaches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Well-defined: fully and precisely defines valid programs and
                  their behavior in a way that is easy to reason about
                  informally and formally.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hardware-independent: can be compiled on all modern
                  architectures, desktop or mobile devices and embedded systems
                  alike.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Language-independent: does not privilege any particular
                  language, programming model, or object model.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Platform-independent: can be embedded in browsers, run as a
                  stand-alone VM, or integrated in other environments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Open: programs can interoperate with their environment in a
                  simple and universal manner.

                  general, Java browser apps or "applets" were a bad experience
                  for users due to loading time, awkward and nonstandard UI
                  elements, and also being complete separate from the web page
                  and not being able to interact with the DOM. Plugins like
                  Flash offered a far better experience. But the browser needed
                  its own native virtual machine and scripting language. So
                  JavaScript was born.

                    <li>
                      Compact: has a binary format that is fast to transmit by
                      being smaller than typical text or native code formats. -
                      Modular: programs can be split up in smaller parts that
                      can be transmitted, cached, and consumed separately.

                    <li>
                      Efficient: can be decoded, validated, and compiled in a

                      or ahead-of-time - AOT - compilation.

                    <li>

              Where does WebAssembly fit into this picture? You might think it
              is just another one of the target assembly languages. That is kind
              of true, except that each one of those languages (x86, ARM )
              corresponds to a particular machine architecture. When you‚Äôre
              delivering code to be executed on the user‚Äôs machine across the
              web, you don‚Äôt know what your target architecture the code will be
              running on. So WebAssembly is a little bit different than other
              kinds of assembly. It‚Äôs a machine language for a conceptual
              machine, not an actual, physical machine. Because of this,
              WebAssembly instructions are sometimes called virtual
              instructions. They have a much more direct mapping to machine code
              than JavaScript source code. They represent a sort of intersection
              of what can be done efficiently across common popular hardware.
              But they aren‚Äôt direct mappings to the particular machine code of
              one specific hardware. Same diagram as above with WebAssembly
              inserted between the intermediate representation and assembly The
              browser downloads the WebAssembly. Then, it can make the short hop
              from WebAssembly to that target machine‚Äôs assembly code. (Credits

              Spoiler: not only by hand Simple add, sub:
              https://webassembly.studio/?f=cogflirmv9m (import "js" "mem"
              (memory 1)) The 1 indicates that the imported memory must have at
              least 1 page of memory (WebAssembly defines a page to be 64KB.) So
              let's see a complete module that prints the string ‚ÄúHi‚Äù. In a
              normal compiled C program, you‚Äôd call a function to allocate some
              memory for the string, but since we‚Äôre just writing our own
              assembly here and we own the entire linear memory, we can just
              write the string contents into global memory using a data section.
              Data sections allow a string of bytes to be written at a given
              offset at instantiation time and are similar to the .data sections
              in native executable formats.

              Mozilla has pushed a lot for web assembly, and it is obviously the
              one language with the best tooling today to do wasm. I won't go
              into rust details here, all you need to know is that it's not GC,
              it's safe by design and it's fast, very fast.

              The GC is not yet implemented for wasm, and you then need to
              package your own GC in all of your wasm files. For Golang, for ex,
              it's 2MB minimum for a simple hello world. The GC is coming soon
              to wasm. I'll talk about it later on the roadmap.
